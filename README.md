# 📡 PRODIGY_CS_05 – Network Packet Sniffer

This project was developed as part of my **Cyber Security Internship at Prodigy InfoTech**. It is a Python-based packet sniffer that captures network traffic and displays key details about each packet.

## 💡 Features

- Captures live network packets
- Displays source and destination IP addresses
- Identifies packet protocol (TCP/UDP/ICMP/etc.)
- Real-time packet analysis in the terminal
